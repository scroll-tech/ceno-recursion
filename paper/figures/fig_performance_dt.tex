  \caption{Runtime evaluation of \CoBBl, as speedup from CirC. Since runtime of \CoBBl~scales with program input but runtime of CirC does not, we derive three scenarios regarding to the workload of \CoBBl: \textbf{CoBBl For} executes the exact program as CirC, where array size and loop iterations are statically bounded; \textbf{CoBBl 75} sets array size and number of iterations on the most dominant loop to be 75\% of the upper bound; and \textbf{CoBBl 50} sets the same parameters to 50\%.}

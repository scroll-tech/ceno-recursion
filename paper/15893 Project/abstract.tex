SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) is a cryptographical protocol widely adopted in cloud computing and blockchain that allows verification of a computation in sublinear time. Existing SNARK systems can be largely divided into two approaches. The compiler approach converts the program into a set of static constraints and generate a proof based on the satisfiability of the constraints, while the virtual machine directly asserts correctness on the sequence of assembly instructions executed by the computation. 

This paper introduces $\CoBBl$, a new SNARK protocol that combines the two existing approaches. Through introducing and modifying the concept of basic blocks, $\CoBBl$ achieves all optimizations present in existing SNARK compilers, while allowing the proof to contain dynamic constraints according to the execution path.

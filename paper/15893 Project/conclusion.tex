\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces \CoBBl, a SNARK system that combines program-specific optimizations with execution-path-specific constraints. We acknowledge that \CoBBl~is an enormous system developed by a single grad student, and thus, demands a long development cycle. While a prototype of \CoBBl~is close to completion, there are still endless opportunities for future optimizations on both the compiler and on creating a more efficient backend protocol. Preliminary testings have shown that the performance of \CoBBl~is on par with state-of-the-art SNARK compilers. We hope that future work on \CoBBl~can further improve the efficiency of the system, bringing it closer to industrial standard.
